#  wavegan clone   

This is cloned from  [chrisdonahue/wavegan](https://github.com/chrisdonahue/wavegan) to learn GAN synthesize.  


## experiment  

This is an expermental script to test wavegan on google colaboratory.

Following is 6 hours train result using sc09 (digits speech).  
D-loss G-loss (until 3k)  
![D-loss G-loss](waveGAN-SC09-D-Loss-G-Loss___until_3k.png)  
  
There are generated wave samples in model.ckp-2995-generated-wave-sample folder.  
Their sound quality is sill low, due to train time is short.
